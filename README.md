# ClassRepWebpage
 This is my very First webpage project that I did in college for WebDevelopment.
 
We were requested to create a basic webpage with a table and other few functionalities. 

#why this page?  
at the start of the year I was elected class representative, during our breaks we use to look around for free computer rooms, at the IT building, so I decided to make a website that will keep all the times that the computer rooms were free in just one space so I could share with my colleagues it easily, and no one will waste too much time seeking for free rooms.
 
 #Extra Information  
once I was confident with HTML at the start of the course, I finished the project earlier so I decided to play around with extra functionalities using HTML5 animations, what got me few extra marks for this first project, the avatars at the Gallery page are my colleges avatars from their Snapchats, I wanted to make this page more about the class and the our group than a personal one.
